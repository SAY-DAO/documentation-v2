# Cache

<Callout>Upgrade to the latest version (â‰¥ 1.0.0) to use this feature.</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  In most cases, you shouldn't directly _write_ to the cache, which might cause
  undefined behaviors of SWR. If you need to manually mutate a key, please
  consider using the SWR APIs.

[Reset Cache Between Test Cases](#reset-cache-between-test-cases).

</Callout>

By default, SWR uses a global cache to store and share data across all
components. But you can also customize this behavior with the `provider` option
of `SWRConfig`.

Cache providers are intended to enable SWR with more customized storages.

## Cache Provider

A cache provider is Map-like object which matches the following TypeScript
definition (which can be imported from `swr`):

```typescript
interface Cache<Data> {
  get(key: string): Data | undefined
  set(key: string, value: Data): void
  delete(key: string): void
}
```

For example, a
[JavaScript Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)
instance can be directly used as the cache provider for SWR.

## Create Cache Provider

The `provider` option of `SWRConfig` receives a function that returns a
[cache provider](#cache-provider). The provider will then be used by all SWR
hooks inside that `SWRConfig` boundary. For example:

```jsx
import useSWR, { SWRConfig } from 'swr'

function App() {
  return (
    <SWRConfig value={{ provider: () => new Map() }}>
      <Page />
    </SWRConfig>
  )
}
```

All SWR hooks inside `<Page>` will read and write from that Map instance. You
can also use other cache provider implementations as well for your specific use
case.

<Callout>
  In the example above, when the `<App>` component is re-mounted, the provider
  will also be re-created. Cache providers should be put higher in the component
  tree, or outside of render.
</Callout>

import { CacheImage } from '@app/_icons'

<CacheImage className="mt-6 dark:invert" />

When nested, SWR hooks will use the upper-level cache provider. If there is no
upper-level cache provider, it fallbacks to the default cache provider, which is
an empty `Map`.

<Callout type="warning">
   If a cache provider is used, the global `mutate` will **not** work for SWR hooks under that `<SWRConfig>` boundary. Please use [this](#access-current-cache-provider) instead.
</Callout>

## Access Current Cache Provider

When inside a React component, you need to use the
[`useSWRConfig`](/docs/global-configuration#access-to-global-configurations)
hook to get access to the current cache provider as well as other configurations
including `mutate`:

```jsx
import { useSWRConfig } from 'swr'

function Avatar() {
  const { cache, mutate, ...extraConfig } = useSWRConfig()
  // ...
}
```
