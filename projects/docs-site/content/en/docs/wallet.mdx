# Cryptocurrency Wallet

## What is an Ethereum Wallet?
To send, receive, and manage cryptocurrencies, you need a tool called an Ethereum wallet. Wallets are applications that allow you to access and interact with your Ethereum account and other blockchains. You can think of it as an online banking application without a bank. A wallet enables you to check your balance, send transactions, and connect to blockchain-based applications (Dapps).

Your wallet is essentially a tool for managing your account on the blockchain platform. No organization, company, or even SAY has access to your wallet. This means you can change your wallet provider whenever you wish. Many wallets also allow you to use multiple Ethereum accounts simultaneously within a single application.

- **Currently, you are able to connect to SAY DAO through Metamask and WalletConnect.**


## Wallet Installation
To utilize certain features of SAY, you need a cryptocurrency wallet. Some of its applications include:
  - Digital signing of needs and requests
  - Participating in SAY's future through voting
  - Storing and managing SAY virtual shares/currency
  - Accessing other features
