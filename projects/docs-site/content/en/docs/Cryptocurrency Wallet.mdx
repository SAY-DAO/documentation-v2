# Cryptocurrency Wallet

## What is an Ethereum Wallet?
To send, receive, and manage cryptocurrencies, you need a tool called an Ethereum wallet. Wallets are applications that allow you to access and interact with your Ethereum account and other blockchains. You can think of it as an online banking application without a bank. A wallet enables you to check your balance, send transactions, and connect to blockchain-based applications (Dapps).

Your wallet is essentially a tool for managing your account on the blockchain platform. No organization, company, or even SAY has access to your wallet. This means you can change your wallet provider whenever you wish. Many wallets also allow you to use multiple Ethereum accounts simultaneously within a single application.

- **Currently, you are able to connect to SAY DAO through Metamask and WalletConnect.**


## Wallet Installation
To utilize certain features of SAY, you need a cryptocurrency wallet. Some of its applications include:
  - Digital signing of needs and requests
  - Participating in SAY's future through voting
  - Storing and managing SAY virtual shares/currency
  - Accessing other features

By clicking the "Connect Wallet" button on the My Page section, the following screen will appear for you. If the Metamask wallet is not installed, it is recommended that you download and install this wallet.

## How to Stay Secure
When it comes to security, utilizing wallets is a change in mindset. Financial freedom and the ability to access and use funds anywhere come with a certain level of responsibility; there is no customer support in cryptocurrencies.

### Take Responsibility for Your Funds
Decentralized exchanges link your wallet to a username and password, allowing you to recover it through traditional methods. Just remember that by doing so, you are trusting the custody of your funds to that decentralized exchange. If the company is attacked or goes bankrupt, your funds are at risk.

### Write Down the Seed Phrase
Wallets provide you with a recovery phrase that you should note down securely somewhere. This is the only way to recover your wallet. Do not store it on your computer; write it down and keep it safe.

See the example below:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content:center">
    <img src="/images/seeds.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>
</div>

### Bookmark Your Wallet
If you are using a web-based wallet, bookmark the website to protect yourself from scams.

### Verify Everything Three Times
Remember that transactions are not reversible and wallets are not easily recoverable, so exercise caution and always remain vigilant.
