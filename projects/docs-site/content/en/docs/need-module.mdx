# The Need Module
The first module defined within SAY, which is also regarded as the project’s foundation, is the Need Module (or Module Zero).

## The Challenge
The process of gathering data from individuals in challenging circumstances is highly costly—an issue that has, in some cases, hindered the updating of this data and even led to neglect of it in certain countries.

Based on this data, the global extreme poverty rate fell from 37.8% in 1990 to 8.4% in 2019, meaning over one billion people escaped poverty. A significant portion of this reduction can likely be attributed to technological innovations and the Green Revolution in agriculture. However, in recent years, this rate has been rising at an unprecedented pace.

Currently, nearly 600 million people worldwide live in extreme poverty, defined as having less than $1.90 per day to cover basic needs such as food, health, shelter, and education.
While addressing an individual’s immediate needs in difficult conditions may provide short-term relief, it does not guarantee long-term progress—or escape from the cycle of poverty. Implementing the most efficient and cost-effective methods to improve the socioeconomic status of under-resourced individuals requires research, theory development, and experimentation. This process itself has prerequisites. For example, to determine the most effective way to allocate every 1,000 tomans (≈$0.03), researchers need financial resources, human capital, and diverse target groups for randomized controlled trials. This enables them to examine causal relationships, derive theories, test those theories, and ultimately scale successful interventions in underprivileged areas.
Consequently, the lack of a comprehensive or accessible database of vulnerable populations, coupled with fragmented financial and human resources, makes the journey from idea to implementation prohibitively expensive and complex for researchers.

## The Proposal
While trust in governmental and non-governmental institutions has declined globally in recent years—with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) being no exception—people across many nations continue to dedicate significant time and resources to helping others.[7] Although only 52% of the public expresses sufficient trust in NGOs [8], this statistic confirms that financial and human resources exist to advance social projects. Moreover, where trust can be built or restored—or where reliance on trust becomes unnecessary—these resources could be further expanded.
By establishing a non-profit, scalable platform that acts as an intermediary between NGOs and diverse community stakeholders—developed through open public participation—resources can be aggregated into a decentralized, accessible database. Through data and resource sharing, this platform not only reduces the cost of transitioning from idea to implementation but also enhances collaboration among NGOs, social workers, and communities.
SAY’s proposed platform is founded on a shared objective. Leveraging supply chain and information technology, it aids NGOs in resource procurement while simultaneously creating transparent pathways to distribute resources and services to broader society.

## Methodology
Crowdfunding [9] is a common method for collecting humanitarian aid. However, insufficient transparency and maximal trust create significant challenges [10][11][12]. In some cases, this approach also leads to sharing children’s identifiable information to exploit the psychological phenomenon known as the "identifiable victim effect"[13]—where individuals are more inclined to donate when observing a specific, identifiable person in hardship compared to a larger group with similar needs.
To protect children’s privacy and ensure maximum transparency, SAY employs a distinct methodology. It simultaneously addresses children’s fundamental needs while collecting data and establishing an international trustless network (i.e., a system requiring no mutual trust between parties).

## SAY's Operational Framework
To implement this methodology, two software applications have been designed—each catering to distinct requirements and serving different participant groups within the ecosystem:

### 1.	Software for NGOs
NGOs register for free on a web-based platform called the ["Social Worker Portal"](https://panel.saydao.org/#/auth/login), hence demonstrating their willingness to enter the SAY ecosystem. After the initial verification of the details and information of the said NGO, it would be possible to input the data of the children under their care into the SAY database. This includes authentic voice recordings and brief narratives about each child’s life. Once no issues are identified with the entered data, the voice note will be editted (to increase the quality) and then the users will be able to opt for a spot as the child's virtual family members. 
Social workers from these NGOs also log identified needs weekly through the portal. These needs may include services such as school tuition or healthcare services, as well as everyday or specific goods procurable via online stores.
### 2.	Software for Users (Virtual Families)
An [application](https://dapp.saydao.org/auth/intro) will also work on the side of uders who are willing to fulfil their social responsibilities by covering the costs of the children's needs. After signing up to the application, the portal will show a randomly chosen profile of a child to the new user.  Then the users are able to join a child’s virtual family by assuming one of the following roles: father, mother, uncle, aunt (paternal or maternal). 
To protect the child’s privacy, a unique avatar and pseudonym are assigned to the child’s profile. Users may listen to the child’s authentic voice recording, read a brief narrative about their life, and cover the cost of logged needs—either individually or collaboratively with other virtual family members.
This system is designed to establish transparent, secure, and trustless interaction between all parties while rigorously safeguarding children’s privacy.
