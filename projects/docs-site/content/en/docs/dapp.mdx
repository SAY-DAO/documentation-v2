# DApp

## What is a DApp?
Decentralized Applications (DApps) refer to software applications that operate in a decentralized manner. Instead of relying on a central server or database, they execute and store their core data and processes on a decentralized infrastructure, such as a blockchain. This architecture enables collective ownership of data and transaction validation without requiring trust in a central authority. Features like transparency, data immutability, censorship resistance, and public verifiability position DApps as leading tools for developing open and participatory systems—where users are not merely consumers, but integral participants in the validation network and decision-making processes.
### SAY's DApp for Virtual Families
Within the SAY ecosystem, the DApp is designed as a tool enabling users to join children's "virtual families" by assuming roles such as father, mother, uncle, aunt, or aunt/uncle, and participate in fulfilling the children’s documented, real-world needs. This decentralized structure ensures that every stage—from identifying needs and sourcing resources to purchasing and delivery—is recorded on a transparent, data-driven infrastructure. Consequently, each user can experience their participation directly and without reliance on a central authority.
This DApp not only bridges social workers, NGOs, and volunteers, but the data generated also serves as a valuable resource for researchers and social policymakers. Thus, every financial contribution within this ecosystem not only provides immediate aid but also actively contributes to strengthening systematic understanding of poverty and its solutions.

## Software for Virtual Families
### Registration and Role Selection
Interested individuals can register in the SAY application using their email address or phone number and by setting a password. Afterwards, by visiting the 'Search' page, it becomes possible to join a child's virtual family.

Currently, virtual families can only access children's profiles through the 'Random Selection' method. After listening to a child's voice and reading their story, the virtual family selects their appropriate role (father, mother, aunt, uncle) and becomes a member of the child's family.


### Fulfilling Children's Needs
Recent registered needs for each child will be communicated to the members of their virtual family via SMS or email. Families can view the list of the child's needs at any time and proceed to pay for and supply them. For each need, it is possible to pay its cost in full, or partially through cooperation with other members of the virtual family. After a need is paid for, virtual families can visit the 'Fulfilled Needs' section to view the receipt of supply and delivery at every stage.

### Token Allocation
As the child's needs are met, tokens will be minted for those virtual family members who participated in paying for that need, through processes and calculations which are fully explained in the [Smart Contracts](https://docs-v2.saydao.org/en/docs/smart-contracts) section. A coefficient named the 'Distance Coefficient' is defined and used to control the population of members in each child's family. If you have not yet participated in fulfilling a need for a child whose family you are a member of, this coefficient will not be calculated, and the process for signing and confirming the need will be halted. To calculate your distance coefficient, you must either select the 'Leave Child's Family' option on the child's page, or pay for one of the child's needs. Therefore, in the end, each virtual family member's participation will influence the token creation process.




## Digital Signature

In the process of using blockchain wallets, the concept of "Wallet Signature" holds great importance. This signature refers to creating a unique digital signature generated by the wallet. The wallet signature serves as verification of the authenticity and validity of transactions and data on the blockchain network.
Specifically, this signature utilizes strong cryptographic algorithms and a private key—stored with maximum security within the wallet—to create digital signatures for every transaction and data transfer.
The core advantage of wallet signatures in blockchain is transaction security and integrity. The digital signature verified by the wallet confirms that the transaction was initiated by the wallet owner, while no alterations were made to its data.
Thus, the wallet signature is the most critical element for verifying identity and validating blockchain transactions. Through this signature, it can be reliably proven that a transaction was conducted by the intended wallet owner and that the transaction data remains definitively accurate.

## Digital Signature of a Need
Every need fulfilled for a child by their virtual family and delivered to the child enters a new phase. In this phase, the need becomes eligible for digital signature by the social worker, the witness, the mediator, and the virtual family members. 
This process is a prerequisite for developing SAY on a blockchain infrastructure and transitioning into a decentralized, autonomous organization.
1.	The social worker who registered the need must provide the initial signature. They re-verify need specifications, NGO details, Child information, Receipts, and confirms them with their signature.
2.	The second signature is provided by the virtual family member(s) who funded the need to verify social worker’s receipts, online store invoices, and bank transaction records.
3.	The mediator—who purchased the good(s) from the online store—provides the third signature to confirm procurement.
4.	The witness (active in quality oversight since need initiation) provides the final signature to authenticate the need and store it on the decentralized IPFS network.
