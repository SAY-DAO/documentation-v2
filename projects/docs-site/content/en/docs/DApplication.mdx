# DApp

## What is a DApp?
Decentralized Applications (DApps) refer to software applications that operate in a decentralized manner. Instead of relying on a central server or database, they execute and store their core data and processes on a decentralized infrastructure, such as a blockchain. This architecture enables collective ownership of data and transaction validation without requiring trust in a central authority. Features like transparency, data immutability, censorship resistance, and public verifiability position DApps as leading tools for developing open and participatory systems—where users are not merely consumers, but integral participants in the validation network and decision-making processes.
### SAY's DApp for Virtual Families
Within the SAY ecosystem, the DApp is designed as a tool enabling users to join children's "virtual families" by assuming roles such as father, mother, uncle, aunt, or aunt/uncle, and participate in fulfilling the children’s documented, real-world needs. This decentralized structure ensures that every stage—from identifying needs and sourcing resources to purchasing and delivery—is recorded on a transparent, data-driven infrastructure. Consequently, each user can experience their participation directly and without reliance on a central authority.
This DApp not only bridges social workers, NGOs, and volunteers, but the data generated also serves as a valuable resource for researchers and social policymakers. Thus, every financial contribution within this ecosystem not only provides immediate aid but also actively contributes to strengthening systematic understanding of poverty and its solutions.





## Concepts 
### Credit
Displays the amount of credit reimbursed to your account.
### Paid Items
Needs you have partially or fully contributed to, which have now been fulfilled.
### Distance Coefficient
The Distance Coefficient measures participation levels within virtual families to regulate their size. This coefficient is not calculated—and need-signing/approval is suspended—if you have not yet contributed to fulfilling any needs of a child whose virtual family you joined. To activate calculation, you must either:
(a) Select the “Leave Family” option on the child’s profile, or
(b) Fulfill at least one of the child’s needs.
The coefficient is computed by comparing:
- **The number of the child’s needs fulfilled by their virtual family**
- **Against the activity levels of family members**
Example: By ranking all uncles’ fulfilled needs across the SAY ecosystem into statistical quartiles, your contribution count (as an uncle) is placed within a quartile. The coefficient is derived from this position and ultimately determines the number of tokens generated per fulfilled need.

### Difficulty Coefficient
The Difficulty Coefficient optimizes need-fulfillment timelines by measuring the relative complexity of each need. It is computed through stage-duration comparisons between a need and similar needs and cost comparisons against recently fulfilled needs.
Factors influencing the coefficient include:
- **Time interval between a need’s registration by a social worker and witness approval**
- **Time interval between approval and payment by the virtual family**
- **Time interval between payment and logistics (procurement by mediators → child delivery)**
These calculations compare the performance of each need stage against quartiles of similar needs (e.g., needs within the same category, such as healthcare). This coefficient is ultimately used to calculate the number of tokens generatable per need.

### Participation Coefficient
The Participation Coefficient per need is measured to encourage collaborative fulfillment. This coefficient is calculated based on the number of virtual family members contributing to each need’s payment.


## Digital Signature

In the process of using blockchain wallets, the concept of "Wallet Signature" holds great importance. This signature refers to creating a unique digital signature generated by the wallet. The wallet signature serves as verification of the authenticity and validity of transactions and data on the blockchain network.
Specifically, this signature utilizes strong cryptographic algorithms and a private key—stored with maximum security within the wallet—to create digital signatures for every transaction and data transfer.
The core advantage of wallet signatures in blockchain is transaction security and integrity. The digital signature verified by the wallet confirms that the transaction was initiated by the wallet owner, while no alterations were made to its data.
Thus, the wallet signature is the most critical element for verifying identity and validating blockchain transactions. Through this signature, it can be reliably proven that a transaction was conducted by the intended wallet owner and that the transaction data remains definitively accurate.

## Digital Signature of a Need
Every need fulfilled for a child by their virtual family and delivered to the child enters a new phase. In this phase, the need becomes eligible for digital signature by the social worker, the witness, the mediator, and the virtual family members. 
This process is a prerequisite for developing SAY on a blockchain infrastructure and transitioning into a decentralized, autonomous organization. [Learn more about such organizations here.]
1.	The social worker who registered the need must provide the initial signature. They re-verify need specifications, NGO details, Child information, Receipts, and confirms them with their signature.
2.	The second signature is provided by the virtual family member(s) who funded the need to verify social worker’s receipts, online store invoices, and bank transaction records.
3.	The mediator—who purchased the good(s) from the online store—provides the third signature to confirm procurement.
4.	The witness (active in quality oversight since need initiation) provides the final signature to authenticate the need and store it on the decentralized IPFS network. [Learn more about IPFS here.]
