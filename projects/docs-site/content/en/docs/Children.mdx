# About the Children
The central focus of SAYâ€™s Need Module and the modules to come, is children who experience challenging financial and family situations and are placed under the care of NGOs. Information about these children is registered in the SAY panel, and their needs, once approved, will be communicated to their virtual family members. These needs, including many sorts of goods and services, cover various aspects of the child's life such as food, clothing, health, hygiene, education, and recreation.

## Child Registration
As mentioned in other sections, SAY refrains from disclosing children's identifying information and their real names and images. However, while protecting the child's privacy, it will also publish an audio file of them speaking, which introduces them to the users. This audio file is essentially an interview conducted between social workers and the children, during which the child voluntarily, by answering the social worker's questions, expresses their goals, aspirations, interests, thoughts, needs, and circumstances. This audio file will show a part of the child's life to users who wish to become members of their virtual family.
A few points regarding the approval of interviews conducted with children:
- Each interview must begin by introducing the social worker and informing the child that their voice is being recorded.
- The recorded audio must be at least 15 minutes long.
- The interview must be flexible and adapt to the child's personality traits.
- The child should not be forced or led to say things that are outside their own mind and world.
- If a child is unable to speak for any reason or prefers to remain silent, recording their silence along with the social worker's voice is acceptable.

- Below is a list of sample questions that can be asked during the interview with the child:
1.	What are you really good at, and how did you learn it?
2.	If you had a magical power, what power would you want to have and how would you use it?
3.	Can you tell me about a time you helped someone or made them happy?
4.	What's the best real or imaginary adventure you've ever had?
5.	If you could build your own world, what would it look like?
6.	Who do you think is the funniest person you know and why?
7.	If you had to teach something to someone or a group of people, what would you choose to teach?
8.	If your friends were to describe you in three words, how do you think they would describe you?
9.	What is something (a quality) that makes you proud of yourself?
10.	Can you tell me about a time you were really brave, or did something even though you were scared?
11.	If you could change one thing in the world, what would you change?
12.	What is something that is very important to you in the world and why?
13.	When you grow up, what do you want to be and why?
14.	What is your favorite animal? If you could be an animal for a day, which one would you choose and why?
15.	If you could spend a day with a character from stories or cartoons, who would it be and what would you do together?
16.	If you could give one good piece of advice to adults, what would you tell them?
17.	Can you tell me about a time you were very upset and how you started feeling better?
18.	If you could change one rule at school or home, what would you change and why?
19.	What do you think is the most important thing a friend should do for you?
20.	If you had the chance to teach everyone in the world just one thing, what would you teach them?
21.	If you could give just one gift to all the people in the world, what would you give and why?
22.	What has been the most interesting thing you've learned or discovered recently?
23.	If you could grant one wish for someone else, whose wish would you grant and what was that wish?
24.	If you could live in any time period (for example, if you had a time machine), which era would you choose and why?
25.	If you could do only one thing for a whole week, what would you do?
26.	How can you tell that someone could be a good friend
