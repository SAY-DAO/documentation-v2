## Introduction
On Saturday, November 9, 2019, the non-profit and open-source project Say began its mission by delivering a backpack, an iron supplement tablet, an eraser, and colored pencils to children under its care. Today, Say is on its path to become an autonomous organization, ensuring a more transparent decision-making process by its members. By creating a database of children in difficult circumstances and building a global network of researchers, social activists, and volunteers, Say aims to address poverty through a systemic approach—breaking it down into smaller, more manageable components. Within the Say ecosystem, each of these components is known as a “module”.

## Module
Within the SAY ecosystem, a "Module" refers to an independent component, each focused on addressing a specific aspect of poverty. These modules, however, are interconnected and function as a cohesive, integrated system.
This modular architecture enables SAY to design the path for child support and empowerment in a step-by-step, measurable, and scalable manner, rather than offering broad, one-step solutions. Through their interaction, modules share human, financial, and data resources. This means the achievements and infrastructure of one module directly contribute to the quality and speed of progress in others.
Such an architecture provides SAY with the flexibility necessary for gradual growth, testing methodologies, and continuous process optimization, without ever requiring a complete system redesign. The first module in this ecosystem is the ["Need Module"](/docs/need-module), which is recognized as the foundation of the entire project.
