# Introduction
On Saturday, November 9, 2019, the non-profit and open-source project Say began its mission by delivering a backpack, an iron supplement tablet, an eraser, and colored pencils to children under its care. Today, Say is on its path to become an autonomous organization, ensuring a more transparent decision-making process by its members. By creating a database of children in difficult circumstances and building a global network of researchers, social activists, and volunteers, Say aims to address poverty through a systemic approach—breaking it down into smaller, more manageable components. Within the Say ecosystem, each of these components is known as a “module”.

## Introducing SAY DAO
The Say DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a decentralized structure that enables collective decision-making and the transparent management of resources dedicated to supporting children. Within this framework, all transactions and contributions are recorded in a decentralized manner, ensuring they are fully traceable and verifiable.
The primary objective of Say DAO is to foster utmost trust among users and organizations active in the field of child welfare. This empowers every individual to confidently and knowledgeably play an effective role in improving children's lives.

## Transparency and Trust
Leveraging a decentralized and self-governing structure, Say DAO strives to enable direct and intermediary-free participation for individuals who believe in children's futures. Within this ecosystem, all operations are conducted with complete transparency. Every interaction, contribution, and payment is recorded in a manner that allows any user to easily track its progress.
In this model, trust is established not through formal institutions, but through the use of technology and the integrity of the processes themselves.


## Family Roles
Within the SAY ecosystem, each real child is the central focus, with their needs being documented by social workers from verified organizations. Users can choose a familial role—such as father, mother, or aunt—and collaborate with others to fulfill a child's needs.
This model of collaborative support not only distributes the responsibility but also fosters a deeper human connection among concerned individuals.


## Smart Support
SAY is dedicated to ensuring that support for children transcends mere financial assistance, evolving into a profound human and emotional experience built upon respect and the preservation of the child's dignity.
To this end, the identities of children remain confidential; their names are changed, and in place of photographs, specially designed avatars are used. These avatars serve to protect the child while ensuring the narrative of their life remains tangible.
In this endeavor, blockchain technology is employed as a tool to guarantee fairness, transparency, and continuity. The creation of a global database of children supported by NGOs worldwide is a crucial step towards reducing inequality. This initiative aims to enhance the understanding of needs and streamline support processes.


## Module
Within the SAY ecosystem, a "Module" refers to an independent component, each focused on addressing a specific aspect of poverty. These modules, however, are interconnected and function as a cohesive, integrated system.
This modular architecture enables SAY to design the path for child support and empowerment in a step-by-step, measurable, and scalable manner, rather than offering broad, one-step solutions. Through their interaction, modules share human, financial, and data resources. This means the achievements and infrastructure of one module directly contribute to the quality and speed of progress in others.
Such an architecture provides SAY with the flexibility necessary for gradual growth, testing methodologies, and continuous process optimization, without ever requiring a complete system redesign. The first module in this ecosystem is the "Need Module," which is recognized as the foundation of the entire project.
