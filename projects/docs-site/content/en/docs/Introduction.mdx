# Introduction
On Saturday, November 9, 2019, the non-profit and open-source project Say began its mission by delivering a backpack, an iron supplement tablet, an eraser, and colored pencils to children under its care. Today, Say is on its path to become an autonomous organization, ensuring a more transparent decision-making process by its members. By creating a database of children in difficult circumstances and building a global network of researchers, social activists, and volunteers, Say aims to address poverty through a systemic approach—breaking it down into smaller, more manageable components. Within the Say ecosystem, each of these components is known as a “module”.
